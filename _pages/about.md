Website under minor construction...

I don't really maintain this bio...

I was a student pursuing an M.Sc in Computer Science at University of California - Berkeley. I was also a researcher in 
RISELab where I work under Prof. Randy Katz on serverless machine learning frameworks and serverless computing. I used 
to TA for CS189: Machine Learning and CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory.
