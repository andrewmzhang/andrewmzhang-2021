I am a student pursuing an M.Sc in Computer Science at University of California - Berkeley. I am interested in systems, image manipulation, and machine learning research. I am also a researcher in RISELab where I work under Prof. Randy Katz on serverless machine learning frameworks and serverless computing. I used to TA for CS189: Machine Learning and CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory.
